# Bit Count
* Time limit: 1280 ms
* Memory limit: 128 MB

You are given an integer N that can be represented on 32 bits. Implement a function that counts the numbers of bits set to 1 in N's binary representation.

#### Desired solution
Try to find something faster than iterating through all the bits.

#### Standard input
The first line contains a single integer N.

#### Standard output
Output a single number, representing the number of bits set to 1 in the binary representation.

| Input | Output |
| :- | :- |
| `23` | `4` |
| `5` | `2` |
