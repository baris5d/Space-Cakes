You should implement a function that takes two integer arguments x y, where both x and y are non-negative integers. Return the result of flipping all of the bits of x that are set to 1 in both x and y.

#### Desired solution
Your function should work in O(1) using bitwise operations.

#### Standard input
The template code reads on the first line a single integer T, representing the number of tests that follow.

Each of the next T lines contains two integers x y represeting a test.

#### Standard output
The template calls your function for each test and prints the result on a new line.
