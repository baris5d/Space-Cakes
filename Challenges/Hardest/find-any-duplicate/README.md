# Find Any Duplicate
* Time limit: 1280 ms
* Memory limit: 128 MB

You should implement a function that takes as argument an array of N+1 integers between 1 and N. Find a value that occurs in the array at least twice.

#### Desired solution
You should solve the problem in O(N) using O(1) memory. You are not allowed to modify the array.

#### Standard input
The code template reads on the first line a single integer N.

The second line contains N+1 integers, representing the elements of the array.

#### Standard output
The template calls your function and outputs the result.
