# Least Significant Bit
* Time limit: 3080 ms
* Memory limit: 128 MB

You should implement a function that takes as argument a positive integer x and returns its least significant bit. More precisely you should return another integer whose binary representation contains a single bit set to 1, and that bit is the least significant one that is also set to 1 in x.

#### Desired solution
Your function should work O(1) using bitwise operations.

#### Standard input
The template code reads on the first line a single integer T, representing the number of tests that follow.

Each of the next T lines contains a single integer x.

#### Standard output
The template calls your function for each test and prints the result on a new line.
